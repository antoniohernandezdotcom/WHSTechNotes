  Following instructions exactly when learning to code is essential for achieving the desired outcomes.
 Coding requires precision; even a small mistake, like a missing semicolon, can cause a program to fail or generate errors. For instance, if a beginner skips a crucial step in a tutorial, the code may not compile, leading to confusion.
 Developing attention to detail early in coding is vital because it fosters accuracy and understanding. Missing steps can create gaps in knowledge, hindering progress. By adhering to instructions, learners build the precision needed for more complex programming tasks, ensuring long-term success.
